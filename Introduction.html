    <h1>A little bit about me </h1>

    <p>
      Hi everybody, My name is Caroline.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil; but I moved to Florianopolis when I was 14. My family and I (that includes my husband and our three children) moved to Auckland, New Zealand almost 4 years ago, and it has been a pleasure to live in this beautiful country.
    </p> 
    <p>
      I love how so many programs and spaces here are designed for families. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Families have many sizes and shapes, but for me they are always at the very center of every important moment and decision in our lives. They are the ones we can always count on with, who always have our backs, and frequently the ones who drive us crazy too. 
    </p>
      <p>
      My family represents to me the values I cherish the most like care, respect and integrity. They also push me to grow, learn and become a better version of myself each day.
      </p>
      <p>
      As a former NICU Nurse I had the privilege of meeting and helping countless families in some of the happiest and hardest moments of their lives. I love helping people.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Now I feel that is time for me to follow a new path to help people. Technology is part of everyone’s lives now and it is a powerful tool to help improve our lives in many different ways.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’m at DevAcademy because I want to help people improve their lives through the wonderful world of technology.    
    </p>
    
    <p>Thank you for having me here! :) </p>
