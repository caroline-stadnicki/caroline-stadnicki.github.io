<p class=" question">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p>
<p>
        Not too long ago, it was believed that a person’s brain was born with all the neuron connections in place with little space for change.  
    It is wonderful to see this concept evolve, providing us with a better understanding of how the brain works and what it’s capable of.
</p>
<p>
        Michael Rugnetta, wrote for <a href=”https://www.britannica.com/science/neuroplasticity” > Britannica.com</a>, explaining that 
    <b>neuroplasticity</b> is the “capacity of neurons and neural networks in the brain to change their connections and behaviour
    in response to <b>new information</b>, <b>sensory stimulation</b>, <b>development</b>, <b>damage</b>, or <b>dysfunction</b>. 
    Although some neural functions appear to be hard-wired in specific, localized regions of the brain, certain neural networks exhibit
    modularity and carry out specific functions while also retaining the capacity to deviate from their usual functions and to reorganize 
    themselves. Hence, neuroplasticity is considered generally to be a complex, multifaceted, fundamental property of the brain. “

        By learning how study, effort and repetition can create and strengthen new synapses, we now have a recipe for successfully developing new skills. 
    Now we know that it is not a matter of having or not a ‘gift’ for a certain thing, but rather a matter of how much effort we put into 
    learning something, and how many times we repeat it until we are confident in what we’ve learned. 
</p>
<p>
        Understanding and teaching about neuroplasticity can break stigmas and create a powerful community of life-long learners that know they 
    can learn anything they what, they can develop any skills they want, despite of where they came from, what their history is or their 
    socio-economic status.
